### code around the root code. 

On a side note - some information about why I took this program

I was the recipient of the 2018 "Google Developer Challenge Scholarship" 
through Udacity but the scholarship was for the Android Developer 
program designed for beginners with no coding experience.

I have spent over a year teaching myself Python and want to take the 
next step that would reflect a natural progression of my current skills. 
So I turned down the scholarship in order to enroll in the Udacity Fullstack Webdeveloper
Nanodegree. This degree is designed for intermediate developers with experience in 
Github, Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This was a difficult choice since I was honored to be a recipient of the scholarship but after taking the Android program for about a week, it just did not feel like the right path.  And I couldn't be happier that I made the choice to change even though it means more out of pocket cost for me.  But I LOVE this course and I love working in Python.
