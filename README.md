# Udacity_FullStack_WebDeveloper

I was the recipient of the 2018 "Google Developer Challenge Scholarship" 
through Udacity but the scholarship was only for the Android Developer 
program designed for beginners with no coding experience.

I have spent over a year teaching myself Python and want to take the 
next step that would reflect a natural progression of my current skills. 
So I turned down the scholarship in order to enroll in the Udacity Fullstack Webdeveloper
Nanodegree. This degree is designed for intermediate developers with experience in 
Github, Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

And I couldn't be happier that I did - I love this course and I love working in Python.  

This respository will be a collection of coursework, all of which will have a root in 
code shown in the lessons however each project challenges the student to build more 
code around the root code.
